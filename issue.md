# Project Issues

## Code Issues

1. **Duplicate Dark Mode Initialization**: 
   - Both `App.tsx` (lines 27-32) and `navbar.tsx` (lines 24-29) are initializing dark mode, which creates redundant code and potential conflicts.

2. **Unused Theme Utility**: 
   - The `initializeTheme()` function in `utils/theme.ts` is defined but not being used anywhere in the application.

3. **Social Links Placeholders**:
   - In `footer.tsx`, all social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter) have placeholder href values (`"#"`) instead of actual links.

4. **Missing Title in HTML**: 
   - The `client/index.html` file doesn't have a title tag, which is important for SEO and browser tabs.

5. **Mobile Menu Animation Issues**:
   - In `navbar.tsx`, the mobile menu (lines 153-193) has excessive styling with animation classes that may conflict with each other.

6. **Inefficient Event Listener in useIsMobile Hook**: 
   - In `use-mobile.tsx`, the resize listener could be optimized with debouncing to prevent excessive re-renders.

7. **Dark Mode Toggle Inconsistencies**:
   - The navbar component forces dark mode on initial load without respecting user preferences that might be stored in localStorage.

8. **Missing Button in Mobile Menu**:
   - There's no dark mode toggle button in the mobile menu, only in the desktop navigation.

9. **Potential Memory Leaks in 3D Scene**: 
   - In `scene.tsx`, there are complex Three.js objects created that might need proper disposal.

10. **No README Content**: 
    - The git status shows `?? README.md`, indicating a new README file that might be empty or incomplete.
